## 1. Background & Motivation <a name="background"></a>
Considering the importance of consumer complaint which provides a significant opportunity to improve the business, this project aimed at using the complaint dataset to classify the complaints according to specified categories they fall on. Complaints are valuable resources to address many business problems. Complaints give an information of the business problem by the experience shared by consumer in the financial marketplace. We can leverage the consumer complaint by identifying the legitimate issues shared by the client. There might be an indication if the business process has been some issues for smooth client services.
When there is a complaint from a client with a product or service of the company, that helps in modifying or improving the service which might related to client relation or other product features or aspect. As these complaints might be accessible publicly, that may allow the public to have an overview of the business or the organization. Consumers are always willing to adhere to the business with less complaint. So, many complaints of the business in the public domain could hamper the business. So, as a final take, companies need to take the complaint as a learning resource for upgrading their product or services.
Financial services like Chase bank are a critical sector which receives many complaints regarding the service provided by the institution. So, in the first place we must segregate those complaints to specific category/class before handling them for further business improvement. To have an overview of the consumer complaint, this project has utilized the dataset from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). CFPB is a U.S. government agency to help consumer to fairly treat by banks, lenders and other financial companies.
## 2. Data & model <a name="data"></a>
The data consists of 1,048,575 observations and 18 features which includes all financial institutions complaints provided on CFPB. I have narrowed down the institution to one to have an overview of one institution which might provide a strong information and to make sure my model doesnâ€™t exhaust available computing resource. As JPMorgan Chase & Co.  is one of the leading financial institutions with great track record and relatively old institution, I have chosen to use the complaint receive by this institution to use as a multi-text classification.
